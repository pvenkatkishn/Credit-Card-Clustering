**<h1>Credit Card Clustering Analysis</h1>**


Project Overview: This project applies various machine learning algorithms for clustering customers based on their credit card usage behavior. The goal is to identify distinct customer segments that can help in targeted marketing strategies, customer retention, and improved financial services.

Key Features
1. Implementation of **K-Means**, **Gaussian Mixture Models**, and **K-Medoids for clustering**.
2. Comparison of clustering results using statistical summaries and visualizations.
3. Analysis of customer profiles for actionable insights.
4. Scalable data preprocessing pipeline using Python.
5. Tech Stack

Programming Language: Python

Libraries:
**numpy** for numerical computations
**pandas** for data manipulation
**matplotlib** and **seaborn** for data visualization
**sklearn** for clustering algorithms


Project Workflow

1. Data Preprocessing:
    1.1. Scaled the features using Standard Scaler to normalize the data.
    1.2. Handled missing values and ensured the dataset was ready for clustering.

2. Clustering Techniques:
    2.1. K-Means: Optimized the number of clusters using the elbow method.
    2.2. Gaussian Mixture Models (GMM): Applied GMM to identify probabilistic clusters.
    2.3. K-Medoids: Used K-Medoids for clustering to minimize the distance metric.

3. Cluster Profiling: Statistical summaries and boxplots were used to analyze the behavior of different clusters.

4. Comparison: Evaluated and compared clustering results from all three algorithms.
